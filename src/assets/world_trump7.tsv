We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more.

Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism! <br><br> "The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level, and in the wake of that conference, nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar over its behavior.  So we had a decision to make:  Do we take the easy road, or do we finally take a hard but necessary action?  We have to stop the funding of terrorism.
